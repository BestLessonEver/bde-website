        <p>I'm Brian Carrion — computer engineer from <strong class="text-white">Texas A&M</strong>, turned professional musician, turned studio owner, turned AI builder. Friendswood, TX. Father of four.</p>
        <p>I founded <strong class="text-white">Best Lesson Ever</strong>, a music lesson studio for kids ages 5–18. Now I'm building AI tools, autonomous agents, and shipping things that didn't exist yesterday.</p>
        <p>I believe in <strong class="text-white">building in public</strong>, moving fast, and figuring it out as you go. This site is where I document the journey — all of it.</p>
