# Why I Build With AI (And Why You Should Too)

Let me tell you something most people won't admit: **the best time to start building with AI was yesterday. The second best time is right now.**

I spent 15 years as a professional musician. I built a music studio from scratch. I've got four kids. And somehow, in the middle of all that chaos, I started building AI tools.

## The Moment It Clicked

It wasn't some grand revelation. I was trying to solve a problem at my studio — how do you keep kids engaged in music practice between lessons? Traditional apps sucked. They were boring. They didn't understand what a 7-year-old needs versus a 15-year-old.

So I started tinkering. And tinkering turned into building. And building turned into an obsession.

## What I've Learned So Far

1. **You don't need a CS degree to start** (though mine from Texas A&M doesn't hurt)
2. **Start with a real problem** — not "what can AI do?" but "what do I need solved?"
3. **Ship ugly, ship fast** — perfection is the enemy of progress
4. **The community is incredible** — people building with AI are the most generous, share-everything crowd I've ever been part of

## What's Next

I'm building in public. Everything — the wins, the failures, the "why did I think that would work" moments. Follow along if you want the unfiltered version.

Because here's the thing: **Brian does everything.** And so can you.
