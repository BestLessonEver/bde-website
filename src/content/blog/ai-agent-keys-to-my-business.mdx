# I Gave an AI Agent the Keys to My Business

I named my AI agent Buddy. Not because I'm sentimental - because I needed something to yell at when it drafts an email that starts with "I hope this message finds you well."

Buddy runs inside my music studio business, Best Lesson Ever. It handles email, marketing research, content drafting, and even helps me build apps. It's the most productive team member I've ever had. It's also the one most likely to go rogue if I'm not paying attention.

## What Buddy Actually Does

Let me be specific, because "AI agent" means different things to different people.

**Email triage.** Buddy reads incoming emails, categorizes them, and drafts responses. Parent asking about lesson times? Drafted. Vendor pitch? Flagged and filed. Actual urgent issue? I get pinged immediately.

**Marketing and research.** It finds local events where we could set up a booth. It researches competitors. It drafts social media posts. It does in 20 minutes what used to take me an entire Sunday night.

**Content creation.** Blog posts, newsletter drafts, ad copy - Buddy writes first drafts of everything. Are they perfect? No. Are they 80% there? Almost always.

**App development.** This one surprises people. Buddy helps me write code, debug issues, and think through product decisions for the tools I'm building. It's like pair programming with someone who never gets tired and never argues about tabs vs spaces.

## What I'd Never Let It Do Unsupervised

Here's where people get nervous, and honestly, they should.

**Send money.** Not a chance. Buddy can draft an invoice, but it's not touching a payment button.

**DM parents directly.** These are real people trusting me with their kids' education. Every parent-facing message gets my eyes before it goes out. Period.

**Post without review.** Buddy drafts. I approve. That's the workflow. One bad post and you lose trust that took years to build.

## The Wins

Last month, Buddy found a community festival in League City that I'd completely missed. We got a booth, signed up 6 new families, and it cost us almost nothing. I never would have found it scrolling through event pages at midnight.

It also caught a scheduling conflict that would have double-booked a teacher for an entire Saturday. The email was buried in a thread I hadn't read. Buddy flagged it at 7am. Crisis averted before coffee.

## The Near-Misses

Early on, Buddy drafted a reply to a frustrated parent that was... technically correct but emotionally tone-deaf. Something like "Per our policy, refunds are not available for missed lessons." Accurate? Yes. The right thing to send to a mom whose kid was home sick? Absolutely not.

That's when I learned: **AI is great at policy. It's terrible at empathy.** At least for now.

Another time, it almost posted a social media draft that referenced a competitor by name. Not maliciously - it was trying to be helpful with a comparison. But that's not how we do things. Caught it in review. Added a rule. Moved on.

## Trust Is Earned Incrementally

Here's the real lesson. I didn't hand Buddy everything on day one. I started with email sorting. Then drafting. Then research. Each level of autonomy came after it proved itself at the previous one.

It's the same way you'd onboard a human employee. You don't give the new hire the company credit card on their first day. You let them earn it.

The difference with AI is that it earns trust faster - but it can also lose it faster. One bad output and you're back to checking everything manually for a week.

**Build the guardrails first. Expand autonomy second.** That's the framework. It's not glamorous, but it works.

And yeah - Buddy still occasionally opens with "I hope this message finds you well." We're working on it.
