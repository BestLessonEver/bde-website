The second best time is right now.**\n\nI spent 15 years as a professional musician. I built a music studio from scratch. I've got four kids. And somehow, in the middle of all that chaos, I started building AI tools.\n\n## The Moment It Clicked\n\nIt wasn't some grand revelation. I was trying to solve a problem at my studio — how do you keep kids engaged in music practice between lessons? Traditional apps sucked. They were boring. They didn't understand what a 7-year-old needs versus a 15-year-old.\n\nSo I started tinkering. And tinkering turned into building. And building turned into an obsession.\n\n## What I've Learned So Far\n\n1. **You don't need a CS degree to start** (though mine from Texas A&M doesn't hurt)\n2. **Start with a real problem** — not \"what can AI do?\" but \"what do I need solved?\"\n3. **Ship ugly, ship fast** — perfection is the enemy of progress\n4. **The community is incredible** — people building with AI are the most generous, share-everything crowd I've ever been part of\n\n## What's Next\n\nI'm building in public. Everything — the wins, the failures, the \"why did I think that would work\" moments. Follow along if you want the unfiltered version.\n\nBecause here's the thing: **Brian does everything.** And so can you.","src/content/blog/why-i-build-with-ai.mdx","99c8eb21d014e619",true]
